/// HOW UNISWAP V3 FLASH LOANS WORK
/// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
///
/// A flash loan lets you borrow ANY amount of tokens from a pool, use them,
/// and repay them + a fee — all in ONE transaction. If you don't repay,
/// the entire transaction reverts as if it never happened.
///
/// The flow is:
///   1. Your contract calls pool.flash(recipient, amount0, amount1, data)
///   2. The pool transfers the borrowed tokens to the recipient
///   3. The pool calls uniswapV3FlashCallback(fee0, fee1, data) on msg.sender
///   4. Inside the callback, you DO SOMETHING with the tokens (arbitrage, liquidation, etc.)
///   5. You must transfer back (amount0 + fee0) of token0 and (amount1 + fee1) of token1
///   6. If you don't repay enough, the pool reverts the entire transaction
///
/// FEE CALCULATION:
///   fee = borrowedAmount * poolFee / 1_000_000
///   Example: Borrow 1000 USDC from a 0.3% pool → fee = 1000 * 3000 / 1_000_000 = 3 USDC
///
/// SECURITY:
///   - ALWAYS verify the callback caller is the expected pool!
///   - Otherwise, anyone could call your callback and drain your tokens.
///
